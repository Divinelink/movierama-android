# Dependency Injection

Dependency injection is important to ensure that portions of our code be easily tested and
dependencies can be changed seamlessly without heavily impacting our application code.

This project uses the [Koin](https://insert-koin.io/) dependency injection library.

Koin is a powerful and user-friendly dependency injection library known for its simplicity and
flexibility.
It doesn't rely on code generation or annotations, making it quick to set up and reducing build
times.
With its dynamic Kotlin DSL, Koin allows for easy configuration of dependencies, offering
flexibility and runtime customization.
Its lightweight nature and idiomatic Kotlin approach make it an ideal choice for developers seeking
an intuitive and efficient dependency injection solution, particularly in projects that prioritize
fast startup times and ease of testing.
