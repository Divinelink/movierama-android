# Dependency Injection

Dependency injection is important to ensure that portions of our code be easily tested and dependencies can be changed seamlessly without heavily impacting our application code. 

This project uses the [Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android) dependency injection library.

We chose Hilt for this project because it's being developed out in the open and we chose to go with Google's official recommendation for dependency injection.
